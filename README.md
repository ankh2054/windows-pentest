#### Powershell/folderperms.ps1
##### Checks for folders in the current PATH variable that are writeable for all authenticated users.

When new folders are created in the root it is writeable for all authenticated users by default. The “NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(I)(M)” gets added to the folder where M stands for modify access. So any application that gets installed on the root can be tampered with by a non-admin user. 

The script checks for any of those folders that are writeable by authenticated users.
